## About Me

Hello, Welcome to my site specifically for the DREAM project. I am Kexin Hao and preferred to be called as Heather. I am pursuing a master’s degree in computer science in the Align program at Northeastern University in Seattle. Prior to studying at NEU align, I was a VMD candidate at UPenn school of veterinary medicine and did researches mostly related to animals and chemicals with some technologies related to computer vision. However, due to own health and finances, I have to switch career. I started interested in the computer science field when my husband proposed to me with an animation created with Turtle in Python during the pandemic and designed my very first [personal site](https://codingheather.github.io/My-Site-/) from scratch before attending NEU.

After a year of training at NEU align, I am very excited to be selected and attend the Distributed REsearch Apprenticeships for Master’s (DREAM) apprenticeship program, and I am also very grateful for being matched to explore more about computer vision. DREAM program is designed for students like me, who do not have a bachelor’s degree in computer science, to participate in a research experience and to offer mentorship aiming to pursue higher education in computing. 

Outside of school, I love playing tennis and accompanying my dogs and cats.
