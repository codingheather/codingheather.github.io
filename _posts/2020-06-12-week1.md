I had my kick-off meeting with Dr. Bruce Maxwell on June 14th. He graduated from Swarthmore college, which is not far away from where I graduated F&M, and he used to swimmed at F&M which makes me feel good. 

We set up a regular meeting time for the project (2 pm on every Thursday afternoon). We discussed his current research projects ongoing, all within the larger idea of evaluating different input data types for computer vision tasks.  There are sub-projects in object recognition, color constancy, adversarial images, super-resolution and intrinsic imaging. All of these make use of deep learning, and he gave me advices on what I need to know about the computer vision aspects. 

For learning machine learning,Jason
